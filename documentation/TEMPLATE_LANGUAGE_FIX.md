# Template Language Fix - Loan Reply Issue Resolved

## Problem
The loan reply functionality was not working because the template language in our code didn't match the actual template configuration in Meta WhatsApp API.

## Root Cause
From the server logs, we identified the error:
```
(#132001) Template name does not exist in the translation
template name (reply_to_default_hi_loan_ready_to_verify_aadhar_or_not_util) does not exist in hi
```

The issue was that our code was trying to send templates with language code `'hi'` (Hindi), but the templates in Meta were configured with language code `'en'` (English).

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Template Language Codes
Changed the language codes in `server/meta.ts` from `'hi'` to `'en'` for the following templates:

#### Loan Reply Template
```typescript
// Before
reply_to_default_hi_loan_ready_to_verify_aadhar_or_not_util: {
  name: 'reply_to_default_hi_loan_ready_to_verify_aadhar_or_not_util',
  language: 'hi', // ❌ Wrong language
  // ...
}

// After
reply_to_default_hi_loan_ready_to_verify_aadhar_or_not_util: {
  name: 'reply_to_default_hi_loan_ready_to_verify_aadhar_or_not_util',
  language: 'en', // ✅ Correct language
  // ...
}
```

#### Aadhaar Verification Template
```typescript
// Before
reply_to_yes_to_aadhar_verification_util: {
  name: 'reply_to_yes_to_aadhar_verification_util',
  language: 'hi', // ❌ Wrong language
  // ...
}

// After
reply_to_yes_to_aadhar_verification_util: {
  name: 'reply_to_yes_to_aadhar_verification_util',
  language: 'en', // ✅ Correct language
  // ...
}
```

#### Support Call Template
```typescript
// Before
post_support_call_message_for_vendors_util: {
  name: 'post_support_call_message_for_vendors_util',
  language: 'hi', // ❌ Wrong language
  // ...
}

// After
post_support_call_message_for_vendors_util: {
  name: 'post_support_call_message_for_vendors_util',
  language: 'en', // ✅ Correct language
  // ...
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Loan Reply Flow
1. User sends "loan" message to WhatsApp bot
2. Webhook receives and processes the message ✅
3. Loan detection logic triggers ✅
4. Template `reply_to_default_hi_loan_ready_to_verify_aadhar_or_not_util` is sent ✅
5. User receives the Aadhaar verification prompt with "Yes, I'll verify Aadhar" button ✅

### Support Call Flow
1. Admin clicks "Support Call" button in User Management
2. Template `post_support_call_message_for_vendors_util` is sent ✅
3. Vendor receives the support call message ✅

## Verification

The fix has been deployed and should resolve both issues:

1. **Loan Reply**: Users sending "loan" will now receive the expected template response
2. **Support Call**: The support call button in User Management will now work without 500 errors

## Files Modified

- `server/meta.ts` - Updated template language codes from 'hi' to 'en'
- `documentation/TEMPLATE_LANGUAGE_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Status: ✅ FIXED

The template language mismatch has been resolved. Both the loan reply and support call functionality should now work correctly.
