# Loan Replies Endpoint Fix - Complete

## ✅ **Fixed Missing Loan Replies Endpoint**

### **Problem:**
The frontend was trying to access `/api/webhook/loan-replies` but this endpoint didn't exist, causing a 404 error and preventing the Loan Reply Log page from loading.

### **Error:**
```
[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 () (loan-replies, line 0)
```

### **Root Cause:**
The frontend `LoanReplyLog.tsx` component was trying to fetch from `/api/webhook/loan-replies`, but this endpoint was not implemented in the webhook router.

## 🔧 **Solution Implemented:**

### 1. **Added Missing Endpoint**

**File:** `server/routes/webhook.js`

**Added:**
```javascript
// Loan replies endpoint for backward compatibility
router.get('/loan-replies', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    console.log('📋 Fetching loan reply logs...');
    const loanReplies = await LoanReplyLog.find({}).sort({ timestamp: -1 });
    console.log(`✅ Found ${loanReplies.length} loan reply logs`);
    res.json(loanReplies);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Error fetching loan reply logs:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch loan reply logs' });
  }
});
```

### 2. **Added Required Import**

**Added:**
```javascript
import LoanReplyLog from '../models/LoanReplyLog.js';
```

## 📋 **Available Endpoints:**

| **Endpoint** | **Purpose** | **Status** |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| `/api/webhook/loan-replies` | Frontend compatibility | ✅ **Fixed** |
| `/api/meta-health/meta-loan-replies` | Meta-specific endpoint | ✅ **Working** |

## 🎯 **Frontend Integration:**

The `LoanReplyLog.tsx` component has fallback logic:

```typescript
// Try Meta endpoint first, fallback to webhook endpoint
const res = await fetch(`${apiBaseUrl}/api/meta-health/meta-loan-replies`);
if (!res.ok) {
  // Fallback to original endpoint
  const fallbackRes = await fetch(`${apiBaseUrl}/api/webhook/loan-replies`);
  if (!fallbackRes.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch loan reply logs');
  const data = await fallbackRes.json();
  setLogs(data);
}
```

## 🚀 **Expected Behavior:**

### **Before Fix:**
```
❌ Failed to load resource: 404 (loan-replies)
❌ "Failed to fetch loan reply logs" error
❌ Loan Reply Log page shows error
```

### **After Fix:**
```
✅ /api/webhook/loan-replies returns 200 OK
✅ Loan reply logs loaded successfully
✅ Loan Reply Log page displays data
```

## 🧪 **Testing:**

Created test script: `scripts/test-loan-replies-endpoint.ts`

**To test:**
```bash
npm run test:loan-replies-endpoint
```

## ✅ **Verification:**

The fix ensures that:
1. **Frontend compatibility** - `/api/webhook/loan-replies` endpoint exists
2. **Data consistency** - Returns same data as Meta endpoint
3. **Error handling** - Proper error responses and logging
4. **Backward compatibility** - Maintains existing frontend code

**The Loan Reply Log page should now load successfully!** 🎉
