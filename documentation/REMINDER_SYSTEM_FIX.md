# Reminder System Fix

## Problem
The vendor reminder system was sending messages continuously every minute from 15 minutes before opening time, instead of sending only 2 messages maximum per vendor per day.

## Solution
Modified the reminder logic in `server/vendorRemindersCron.js` to:

1. **Send only 2 messages maximum per vendor per day:**
   - First message: 15 minutes before opening time
   - Second message: At opening time (only if location not shared)

2. **Skip the second message if vendor has already shared location:**
   - Added location checking using the existing `hasLocationToday()` function
   - If vendor shares location after the first message, the second message is skipped

## Changes Made

### File: `server/vendorRemindersCron.js`

**Before:**
- Messages were sent continuously every minute
- No location checking for the second message
- Could result in multiple messages being sent

**After:**
- Only 2 messages maximum per vendor per day
- First message at exactly 15 minutes before opening time
- Second message at opening time, but only if vendor hasn't shared location
- Proper logging for skipped messages due to location sharing

### Key Logic Changes:

1. **15-minute reminder (unchanged):**
   ```javascript
   if (diff === 15) {
     if (!(await hasReminderSentToday(user.contactNumber, 15))) {
       // Send reminder
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Opening time reminder (modified):**
   ```javascript
   if (diff === 0) {
     const hasLocation = await hasLocationToday(user.contactNumber);
     
     if (hasLocation) {
       console.log(`‚è© Skipping open-time reminder for ${user.contactNumber} - location already shared today`);
       skippedCount++;
     } else if (!(await hasReminderSentToday(user.contactNumber, 0))) {
       // Send reminder
     }
   }
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced message spam:** Vendors receive maximum 2 messages per day instead of continuous messages
2. **Better user experience:** No duplicate messages if vendor has already shared location
3. **Cost effective:** Fewer messages sent = lower Twilio costs
4. **Proper tracking:** Clear logging shows when messages are skipped due to location sharing

## Testing

Created test script `scripts/test-fixed-reminder-logic.ts` to verify the logic works correctly.

## Files Modified

- `server/vendorRemindersCron.js` - Main reminder logic
- `scripts/test-fixed-reminder-logic.ts` - Test script (new)

## No Other Changes Needed

The existing cron job schedule (`* * * * *` - every minute) remains the same, but now the logic ensures only 2 messages maximum are sent per vendor per day.
