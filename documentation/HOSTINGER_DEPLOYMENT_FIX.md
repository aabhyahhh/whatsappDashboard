# Hostinger Deployment Fix - .htaccess File Issue

## Problem
The `.htaccess` file was not visible when uploading the build folder to Hostinger's public_html directory, causing React Router and other server configurations to not work properly.

## Root Cause
- `.htaccess` files are hidden files (start with a dot)
- Some file managers and FTP clients don't show hidden files by default
- Hostinger's control panel might hide `.htaccess` files
- The file was being copied correctly by Vite, but wasn't visible during upload

## Solutions Implemented

### Solution 1: Automatic htaccess.txt Creation
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to automatically create a visible `htaccess.txt` file during build
- This file can be easily renamed to `.htaccess` on Hostinger

### Solution 2: Deployment Script
- Created `scripts/deploy-to-hostinger.sh` for automated deployment preparation
- Creates a `deployment` folder with all necessary files
- Includes detailed deployment instructions

### Solution 3: Package.json Script
- Added `npm run build:hostinger` command for easy deployment

## How to Deploy

### Method 1: Using the Deployment Script (Recommended)
```bash
npm run build:hostinger
```

This will:
1. Build your project
2. Create a `deployment` folder
3. Copy all build files to the deployment folder
4. Create a visible `htaccess.txt` file
5. Generate deployment instructions

### Method 2: Manual Build
```bash
npm run build
```

The build will automatically create both:
- `.htaccess` (hidden file)
- `htaccess.txt` (visible file)

## Uploading to Hostinger

1. **Upload all files** from the `deployment` folder to your Hostinger `public_html` directory
2. **Rename `htaccess.txt` to `.htaccess`** in your Hostinger file manager
3. **Ensure `.htaccess` is in the root** of your public_html directory

## If .htaccess is Still Not Visible

### Option 1: Use FTP Client
- Use FileZilla or similar FTP client
- Enable "Show hidden files" option
- Upload the `.htaccess` file directly

### Option 2: Manual Creation
- Copy the content from `htaccess.txt`
- Create a new file named `.htaccess` in Hostinger
- Paste the content

### Option 3: Hostinger File Manager
- Look for "Show hidden files" option
- Or use the "New File" option and name it `.htaccess`

## What the .htaccess File Does

The `.htaccess` file provides:
- **React Router support**: Handles client-side routing
- **Security headers**: XSS protection, content type options
- **Asset caching**: Improves performance for static files
- **File compression**: Reduces file sizes for faster loading

## Verification

After deployment, verify that:
1. Your React app loads correctly
2. Client-side routing works (try navigating to different pages)
3. Static assets load properly
4. No 404 errors for routes

## Files Modified

- `vite.config.ts` - Added htaccess-copy plugin
- `scripts/deploy-to-hostinger.sh` - Created deployment script
- `package.json` - Added build:hostinger script
- `public/htaccess.txt` - Created visible htaccess file

## Troubleshooting

If you still have issues:
1. Check that `.htaccess` is in the root of public_html
2. Verify the file permissions (should be 644)
3. Ensure Hostinger supports .htaccess files
4. Check Hostinger's error logs for any issues
