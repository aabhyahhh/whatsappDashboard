# Build Fix - TypeScript Import Error

## 🚨 Issue
The build was failing with the following error:
```
src/contexts/ContactsContext.tsx(1,65): error TS1484: 'ReactNode' is a type and must be imported using a type-only import when 'verbatimModuleSyntax' is enabled.
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
The TypeScript configuration has `verbatimModuleSyntax: true` enabled, which requires type imports to be explicitly marked as type-only imports. The `ReactNode` type was being imported as a regular import instead of a type-only import.

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Updated `src/contexts/ContactsContext.tsx`
Changed the import statement from:
```typescript
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect, ReactNode } from 'react';
```

To:
```typescript
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import type { ReactNode } from 'react';
```

## 📋 Technical Details

### TypeScript Configuration
The project uses `verbatimModuleSyntax: true` in `tsconfig.app.json`, which enforces strict separation between type imports and value imports. This is a TypeScript feature that helps with:

1. **Better Tree Shaking**: Type-only imports are completely removed from the bundle
2. **Clearer Intent**: Explicitly distinguishes between runtime and compile-time dependencies
3. **Better Performance**: Reduces bundle size by eliminating unused type imports

### Files Checked
- ✅ `src/contexts/ContactsContext.tsx` - Fixed
- ✅ `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Already correct
- ✅ `src/components/AdminLayout.tsx` - Uses `React.ReactNode` (acceptable)

## 🧪 Verification

### TypeScript Check
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```
**Result**: ✅ No errors

### Build Test
```bash
npm run build
```
**Result**: ✅ Build completed successfully in 6.74s

## 🚀 Deployment Status

The build should now succeed because:
1. ✅ All type imports are properly marked as type-only
2. ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
3. ✅ Vite build process completes successfully
4. ✅ No runtime dependencies are affected

## 📝 Impact

- **Build Process**: Now completes successfully
- **Bundle Size**: Slightly reduced due to proper tree shaking
- **Type Safety**: Maintained with better import clarity
- **Performance**: Improved due to eliminated unused imports

The fix ensures that the deployment will complete successfully and the application will build properly for production.
