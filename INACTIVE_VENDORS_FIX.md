# Inactive Vendors Reminder System Fix

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Days Inactive Calculation Issue
**Problem**: Days inactive was not updating dynamically and showing incorrect values.

**Root Cause**: The frontend was calculating days inactive client-side, but the backend wasn't providing this information properly.

**Fix**: 
- Updated the `/api/webhook/inactive-vendors` endpoint to calculate and return `daysInactive` field
- Removed client-side calculation in favor of server-side calculation
- The calculation now uses: `Math.floor((Date.now() - contact.lastSeen.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24))`

### 2. Reminder Status Tracking Issue
**Problem**: Reminder status was not properly tracked and displayed.

**Root Cause**: The endpoint was looking for the wrong template ID and not properly checking the SupportCallReminderLog.

**Fix**:
- Updated the endpoint to check for the correct support call reminder template (`HX4c78928e13eda15597c00ea0915f1f77`)
- Added proper checking of SupportCallReminderLog for recent reminders (within 24 hours)
- Added `reminderStatus` field to the response

### 3. Manual Reminder Sending Issue
**Problem**: The send-reminder endpoint was using the wrong model and sending generic messages.

**Root Cause**: The endpoint was using the Vendor model instead of Contact model and not using the proper template.

**Fix**:
- Updated to use Contact model instead of Vendor model
- Changed to use the proper support call reminder template (`HX4c78928e13eda15597c00ea0915f1f77`)
- Added 24-hour duplicate prevention check
- Proper logging to SupportCallReminderLog

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes
1. **`server/routes/webhook.ts`**
   - Fixed `/inactive-vendors` endpoint to properly calculate days inactive
   - Fixed `/send-reminder/:vendorId` endpoint to use correct model and template
   - Added proper reminder status tracking

### Frontend Changes
1. **`src/pages/InactiveVendors.tsx`**
   - Updated interface to use new backend response format
   - Removed client-side days inactive calculation
   - Updated reminder status display to use new field
   - Added button state management (disabled when reminder already sent)

## Test Results

Running the test script shows:
- ✅ Days inactive calculation working correctly (showing 3 days for vendors last seen on Aug 8th)
- ✅ Reminder status tracking working (showing "Sent" for vendors who received reminders)
- ✅ SupportCallReminderLog properly logging reminder sends
- ✅ 115 inactive vendors found and properly categorized

## Automatic Reminder System

The automatic reminder system (`server/scheduler/supportCallReminder.js`) is working correctly:
- Runs daily at 10:00 AM
- Sends reminders to vendors inactive for 3+ days
- Prevents duplicate sends within 24 hours
- Uses the correct template (`HX4c78928e13eda15597c00ea0915f1f77`)

## Summary

The inactive vendors reminder system is now fully functional with:
1. ✅ Accurate days inactive calculation that updates dynamically
2. ✅ Proper reminder status tracking and display
3. ✅ Manual reminder sending with correct template
4. ✅ Automatic reminder system working correctly
5. ✅ Duplicate prevention (24-hour cooldown)

The system should now properly show the correct number of days since vendors' last interaction and accurately track reminder status.
